- ðŸ’» I recently finished my studies at [Dev Academy Aotearoa](https://devacademy.co.nz/) which was a 17 week course, where I got to learn Full-stack web-development. This experience allowed me to pursue my interest in web development, refining my skills and giving me the necessary tools to become a well-equipped developer. During my study I got to learn about Typescript, React, Node.JS, Express Router, and many other software tools.
  
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [news-website](https://github.com/tyrone-leef/news-website) which is as you guessed it, a news website using an external API from [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/). I am planning to work on the backend so that I can create a login/register for users so that they can make comments under posts or maybe add posts of their own.
  
- ðŸ‘¯ During my studies at Dev Academy I worked on a clicking game [clicky](https://github.com/tyrone-leef/clicky) with a group of 3 others. The purpose of this game was to improve reaction time and increase accuracy. This was to be presented as our final group project and it was a valuable experience as we all got to learn many different things about how we could create such a game. I worked on the front-end and the styling of the website using Tailwind CSS. I undertook various tasks, including randomising the position of shapes, the start and restart buttons, resizing the game window, and testing client-side routes. Additionally, I employed Framer Motion to incorporate smooth transitions between each page.
